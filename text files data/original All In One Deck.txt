If you possess enough shellfish, you can bribe anyone.	84	5	To the left we have the primitive for a shellfish, and to the rightthe kanji we just learned for possess. Keep the connotation ofthe last frame for the word possess, and now expand your imageof shells to include the ancient value they had as money (ausage that will come in very helpful later on).

Tribute is the craft of raising money.	85	5	A tribute has a kind of double-meaning in English: honor paidfreely and money collected by coercion. Simply because a rulerbestows a noble name on a deed is hardly any consolation tothe masses who must part with their hard-earned money. Littlewonder that this ancient craft of getting money by calling it atribute has given way to a name closer to how it feels to thosewho pay it: a tax.

To craft a page well, we need paragraphs.	86	5	"To the right we see a head and to the left an element that meanscraft. When we think of a paragraph, we immediately think ofa heading device to break a text into parts.

If you look really close this kanji looks like a person bending over touching the ground Waiting for someone to put there sword in his ass!	87	5	Although this character no longer looks very much like asword, it does have some resemblance to the handle of thesword. As it turns out, this is to our advantage, in that it helpsus keep distinct two primitive elements based on this character.	"<img src=""刀.gif""/>"	* In the form of the kanji, this primitive means a dagger. Whenit appears to the right of another element, it is commonlystretched out like this and takes the sense of a great andflashing saber, a meaning it gets from a character we shalllearn later (frame 1671).

Success (or survival?) method for accelerated juggling course: focus on a few nitroglycerine filled juggling balls flying OVER your eyes ---(I have trouble with this few primitive that can be anywhere in a kanji. To build in its location in the story is important somehow).	131	7	When we think of focusing on something, we usually take it ina metaphorical sense, though the literal sense is not far behind.It means to block out what is nonessential in order to fix oureye on a few important matters.

The thick cliff walls protected the children from the sun.	132	7	When we refer to someone as thick-skinned or thickheaded,we are usually quick to addeven if only under our breathsomething about their upbringing, since we cherish the beliefthat by nature people are basically tender and sensitive. TheJapanese character for thick depicts a child abandoned out onthe wild cliffs, exposed to the heat of the sun, and thus doomedto develop a head and skin as thick as the parent who left itthere.

All of this is more than evident in the kanji given here,a pictograph of a stream.	"<img src=""川.gif""/>"	* As a primitive, this character adds to the meaning of streamthe more vivid image of a flood.

Picture Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer floating by state after state as they adventure down the mighty Mississippi, occasionally beaching their raft on sandbars."	135	8	Here we see drops of land (little islets) rising up out of a stream,creating a kind of sandbar or breakwater.

"For those having issues with this* ""A 7K foot pool of water"" Notice it looks like a 7, and a K. Might have to practice writing it a few times."	137	8	This character, which looks a bit like a snowflake, is actually apictograph of waternot any particular body of water ormovement of water, but simply the generic name for water.Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think ofa walking stick being dropped vertically into the water, sendingdroplets out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn ishow to write it in proper order.

The extradrop to the left, added as a second stroke, changes the picturefrom a splash caused by a walking stick dropped into water toform an icicle. If you hold an icicle up to the light, you can usuallysee little crystallizations of five-pointed stars inside of it,which is the shape we have in this kanji.

(In order to remember that the drop is at the top, think that the drop must come from the topmost water in order for its effects to be true).	139	8	"This kanji also uses the full form of water, though its meaningseems to have nothing at all to do with water.

Perhaps the most common appearance of this kanji is in the word 温泉 (おんせん, onsen), a Japanese hot spring. The kanji is an excellent image of someone enjoying a Japanese hot spring: a little white towel on top, water below. (This helps keep all associations: spring, little and onsen).	140	8	"Call to mind the image of a fresh, bubbling spring of water, andyou will probably notice how the top of the spring you arethinking of, the part where the ""bubbling"" goes on, is all white.Happily, the white is just where it should be, at the top, and thewater is at the bottom."

Sorry about this, but Heisig was stupid calling this kanji meadow, used in composite words the most common meaning is ORIGIN... To remember just think that life may have begun in pounds or springs in a land with many cliffs ... Just to answer correctly the review lessons think of meadow as the origin of a huge forest.	142	8	"Though the kanji is broad enough to embrace both meanings,the meadow you should imagine here is not a flatland plain buta mountain meadow in the Austrian Alps. (Perhaps the openingscene of ""The Sound of Music"" will help.) Simply think oflittle springs bubbling up across the meadow to form a sort ofpath that leads you right to the brink of a precipitous cliff.

A marsh is where water is seduced into the ground.	145	8	Unlike the meadow with its cliffs, the marshlands are low andnear a source of water that feeds them until they get soggythrough and through. Why certain land becomes marshy isprobably due to the fact that it felt thirsty, and so tried its bestto seduce the water over to its side.

While the geological history of the larger bodies of wateris hard to surmise sometimes, all of us know from our childlesson8hood how creeks are made. You probably even dug one or twoin your time.

See how an apparently complex kanji falls apartneatly into manageable pieces?To get the meaning of the key word tide, just think of it inconnection with the character for eventide that we learned backin frame 110. Here we have the morning-tide, its complement.By the way, if you missed the question about the number ofprimitives, it is probably because you forgot what we said earlierabout kanji becoming primitives, independently of thepieces that make them up.

The head is set afire, causing deep torment ofspirit (and a whopper of a headache).	"<img src=""煩.gif""/>"		"<img src=""ex_煩.png""/>"	
淡	タン	あわ.い		thin, faint, pale, fleeting	冷淡(れいたん): coolness; indifference<br>淡水(たんすい): fresh water (i.e. not salt water)	1	S	1436	水: water<br>炎: inflammation; flame; blaze	11	水	85	4	みず・したみず・さんずい	(none)	形声 Phonetic	thin	Drink water and burn twice as many calories as you eat... you´ll definitely get thin. Imagine inside your body, all those calories literally being burned from above and below... THAT´s what it takes to become thin.	Thin girls are twice as hot when they´re wet.	176	8	The primitives in this kanji read: water . . . inflammation. Takinginflammation in its medical sense, the first water-relatedinflammation that pops into mind is dehydration, the principalsymptom of which is that it makes one shrivel up and lookvery, very thin. If that is hard to remember, try thinking itbackwards: a very thin chap passes by and you imagine himsuffering from (being inflamed with) dehydration (hence theelement for water).

A lamp is fire you can hang from a nail.	177	8	Since it is very hard to read by the fireplace without going blindfrom the flickering of the flames or burning up from the heat,our ancestors invented a way to nail down a bit of that fire, justenough to light up the text of their evening newspapers and nomore. Voil! The lamp.	"<img src=""灯.gif""/>"		"<img src=""ex_灯.png""/>"	
畑		はた、はたけ、-ばたけ	かま, まま	"farm, field, garden, one's specialty, (kokuji)"	畑(はたけ): (1) field (for fruits, vegetables, etc.); cultivated land; vegetable plot; kitchen garden; plantation (2) field (of specialization); sphere; area (3) womb; birth; birthplace<br>畑地(はたち): farmland	2	3	1176	火: fire<br>田: rice field; rice paddy	9	田	102	5	た・たへん	(none)	国字 Original	farm	Many farms are created by first setting FIRE over the land to clear the land for the FIELDS.	When creating a farm, the prospective farmer must first set fire to the forest to clear the ground. Only then can he plow the fields. Fire before fields to make a farm.	178	8	Looking at the primitives, a fireplace and a rice field, we find theessential ingredients for a farm: a warm hearth to sit by atnight, and a well-plowed field to grow one´s crops in by day.	"<img src=""畑.gif""/>"		"<img src=""ex_畑.png""/>"	
災	サイ	わざわ.い		disaster, calamity, woe, curse, evil	災害(さいがい): calamity; disaster; misfortune<br>火災(かさい): conflagration; fire<br>戦災(せんさい): war damage<br>天災(てんさい): natural calamity; disaster<br>災難(さいなん): calamity; misfortune; disaster	1	5	976	巛: curving river radical (no.47)<br>火: fire	7	火	86	4	ひ・ひへん・れっか・れんが	(none)	会意 Compound Ideographic	disaster	What a disaster! First a FIRE, then on top of it came FLOODs.	Don´t know about Japan, but here in Australia, flooding rivers and bushfires are the most common natural disasters.	179	8	Of all of nature´s disasters, this kanji picks out two of theworst: floods and fires. To recall the disposition of the elements,think of nature´s solution to nature´s own problem: a greatflood pouring down over a great forest fire.	"<img src=""災.gif""/>"		"<img src=""ex_災.png""/>"	
灰	カイ	はい		ashes, puckery juice, cremate	灰色(はいいろ): grey; gray; ashen<br>灰皿(はいざら): ashtray<br>灰(はい): ash; ashes	2	6	1717	厂: wild goose; trailing cliff radical (no. 27)<br>火: fire	6	火	86	4	ひ・ひへん・れっか・れんが	(none)	会意 Compound Ideographic	ashes	The fire underneath the cliff will eventually turn everything above to ashes.	"Scene from ""The Big Lebowski"" : Walter scatters Donny´s ashes, but a wind blows much of the ashes into ""The Dude"" Lebowski´s face. Upset, The Dude lashes out at Walter. Walter apologizes and hugs The Dude, before suggesting ""Fuck it, man. Let´s go bowling."" I bet you that The Dude wanted to cremate (fire) Walter right there and then, at the top of the cliff! (thanks Elktapestry)."	180	8	The kanji for ashes naturally includes the primitive for fire, ormore specifically, a fireplace. Now what do you do with thatbucket of ashes you have just cleaned out of the fireplace? Youwalk to the edge of a cliff and tip it upside down, watching asthey are swept away in the wind like a swarm of gray mosquilesson8toes. Thus the fire, once it has turned to ashes, ends up at thebottom of the cliff.	"<img src=""灰.gif""/>"		"<img src=""ex_灰.png""/>"

You have to stimulate the G-spot with your magic wand in order to get her on fire. Or you can juste use your mouth...	181	8	If you look into the flickering of a fire for a long time and thenturn aside, you will see spots before your eyes. Althoughnobody ever thought of such a thing beforeas least as far asknow, they didn´timagine using those spots as a techniquefor fortune-telling. The old witch sits before her cauldron andwatches the spots that show up when she turns to look at you,and from that tells your fortune.	"<img src=""点.gif""/>"		"<img src=""ex_点.png""/>"

The sun was seduced to give us fire, by which we illuminate the night.	182	8	Although the range of possible meanings that the kanji for illuminatecan have is about as rich as the connotations of theEnglish word, we need to focus on just one of them: to makesomething shine. If you glaze a pot and put it into the oven tofire it, you in fact illuminate it. Hence the kanji for illuminatecompares the kanji for shining with the primitive element forthe oven´s fire.

When I think of bound up cooked rice, it makes me think of sushi, which in turn brings to mind fish.	Bind that FISH and cook his brains! Yarhh!	183	8	The composition of this kanji shows three elements, which welist in the order of their writing: bound up . . . rice field . . . cookingfire. We can join them together by thinking of a three-partstory: first a fish is caught and bound up on a line with itsunfortunate school-mates; when the fisherman gets home, hecuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the ricefields for fertilizer; and the rest he sets in a skillet over a cookingfire for his supper.

If you are confusing this with angling like me, take fishing to mean not the act of catching a fish but the act of being a fish not living but fishing (i.e. in the water).	184	8	To the story we have just made about fish, this kanji for theprofession of fishing adds yet another element before the others:namely the water, where the fish was happily at homebefore being caught, disemboweled, and eaten.

Hint: Heisig makes here a severe disservice to everyone by using a weird keyword for this character. You´ll save a lot (and I mean, a whole lot) of trouble later by giving it instead its intended meaning: House of the Parents.	185	9	"That´s righta ri. Don´t bother looking it up in your Englishdictionary; it´s a Japanese word for measuring distances. One riis about 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles. The kanji depicts how themeasure came to be used. Atop we see the rice field, and belowthe element for land. Those four sections you see in the ricefield (and which we made mention of when first we introducedthe character in frame 14) are actually measurements of land,much the same as farm-sections in the United States havegiven us the notion of a ""country mile."" The land divisionbased on the size of a rice field is called a ri."

If your parent´s home catches on fire, it will turn black.	186	9	Like most things electrical, a computer, too, can overheat.

Anyone who has worked with laserjet ink cartridges will know the black ink looks like powdered dirt.	187	9	Besides meaning black ink, this kanji also appears in the wordfor an inked string that is pulled taut and snapped to mark asurface, much the same as one might used a chalked string.Here it is used to mark off the dirt with black lines for a footballgame (played, I presume, on a white field).

The fish got carpal tunnel syndrome from the computer(I know it´s lame but it´s hard to find a good story for this).	188	9	These are the same carp you see in Japan´s famous carpstreamers.

If you find that by nightbreak, you´re still playing at your computer, chances are your World of Warcraft character has a high quantity of levels. [thanks to ssmoler] ..... To remember that nightbreak appears ABOVE computer, think of looking UP from your computer at the window to realize you´ve been playing until nightbreak.	189	9	Think of quantity as having to do with measuring time anddistance, and the rest is simple: you have a quantity of time inthe new day that begins with nightbreak, and a quantity of distancein the rural ri.

You can only relax, when you have woman under roof to do all chores.	202	9	To be told that the place of the woman is in the house may notsit well with modern thought, but like all cultural habits theChinese characters bear the birthmarks of their age.

The only difference is that our cur-rency is not paper bills but shells, a not uncommon unit ofexchange in older civilizations.

A tree covered in poison ivy will quickly betray you, thus the name JAPANESE JUDAS-TREE.	210	10	Unless you are a botanist, you are not likely to know what aJapanese Judas-tree looks like, and probably never even heardof it before, but the name is sufficiently odd to make rememberingit easy.

(If you don´t know the story, take abreak today and hunt it down in a dictionary of myth andfable.

Fixingcandles to the branches of evergreen trees, it was believed,would lure the sun back (like things attracting like things),whence the custom of the lighted tree that eventually found itsway into our Christmas customs.

This is just a picture of a wall calendar with a page for each month. The bottom half has the grid of days, the top half has a pretty picture of a forest this month. The cliff radical here is the top and left edges of the paper. You can see the paper curling up at the lower left where a breeze is trying to turn the page.	226	10	Look at this character in reverse order, from bottom up. Firstwe see the primitive for days, an appropriate enough way tobegin a calendar. Next we see a grove of trees growing under acliff. The laws of nature being what they are, the trees would bestunted under such conditions, unless they were strong enoughto keep growing upwards until they passed through the layersof rock and soil, right up to the surface. Now imagine that inthose little boxes marking off the days on your wall calendar,you see that very process taking place step by step: 365 or sotime-lapse pictures of that grove of trees each month, from Januaryunder the cliff to December on top of the cliff.

[Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree (木) is not yet (末) vermilion (朱).	229	10	As the key word suggests, this kanji has to do with somethingnot quite over and done with. More concretely, it shows us atree that is not yet fully grown. The extra short stroke in theupper branches shows new branches spreading out, leavingone with the feeling that the tree has a ways to go yet before itreaches maturity.

The first stroke shows a branch that is longerthan the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached theextremity of its growth, so that its branches stop spreading andstart drooping downwards.

The derivates from opium poppies such as morphine can be used to tame the suffering of the old.	239	10	The picture of suffering we are given here is that of a flowerthat has grown old.

(落 薄 藩 藻) It may be helpful to create a primitive keyword for this occurrence (like seaweed or watering can) which can save a lot of time distinguishing them from characters like Sino 満 and Full 満, where the water primitive is larger than the flower primitive.	242	10	"Take a good look at this kanji: the ""strong"" element here isreally the flower, not the water as you might have thought onfirst glance.

The flower generation spent far too much time up trees trying to smoke leaves.	243	10	"Three elements are given here: flower . . . generation . . . tree.

The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones isunimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like amarble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This kanjicontinues with the modernization trend by picturing imitationtrees in the graveyard. But of course, how convenient!

The water in the graveyard has worn away the headstones, so the writing is vague.	245	10	Think of the key word as having to do with something viewedthrough a haze, or in the twilight and from a distance, so thatonly its outlines are vaguely discernible. Now we are backagain to the essence of the true graveyard.

King Koopa consistently captures Princess Peach. Eventually he´s going to run out of castles and just set her in a tree.	251	11	To associate the peach tree with the primitive for a portent,recall the famous Japanese legend of Momotar, the PeachBoy.

(The contest wasn´t fair, because turtles have nictitating membranes, and don´t need to blink so often.) Eye comes first, because stare is most associated with eyes. And compare with challenge (#658) where this same obstreperous turtle challenges you to a finger wrestling contest. (Sibyl´s story with some notes that helped me).	252	11	"To give someone the ""evil eye"" is to stare at them, wishingthem evil.

If we remember large (#107) as a man with his arms outstretched, the drop represents man´s best friend - a dog.	253	11	We have already learned that the character for large takes onthe meaning of the St. Bernard dog when used as a primitive.In this frame we finally see why. The drop added as a fourthand final stroke means that we have to do with a normal-sizeddog, which compared to the St. Bernard is no more than a dropin the kennel.	"<img src=""犬.gif""/>"	* As a primitive this character can take two meanings. In theform given here it will mean a very small dog (which we shallrefer to as a chihuahua for convenience sake).

""Well, isn´t that special""."	261	11	Despite the strong phonetic similarity, there will be no problemkeeping the key word special distinct from the characterwe met earlier for specialty (frame 46), since the latter hasimmediate connotations lacking in this kanji. Anyway, let specialrefer to something in a special class all its ownlike thesacred cows of India that wander freely without fear of beingbutchered and ground into hamburger. Though the practice isa Hindu one, the Buddha´s refusal to take the life of any sentientbeing makes it only fitting that the cows should be placedon the sacred grounds of a Buddhist temple in this kanji.

First, the caterpillar gets under a large flower (bees tend to hang around flowers, which scare away other predators). Then, in the first frame, we see the caterpillar (insect). Then, a bar separating this frame from the next frame (remember that Japanese manga run the other way!), in which we see the insect covered with thread, making a beautiful cocoon.	The magic flower is the reason why Spider-Man ended up miniaturized and confined inside a hood-like cocoon together with an insect. Now, only a walking stick separates them both.	2025	51	Though it´s a good thing that the primitive for cocoon has beenradically abbreviated from this, its full form as a kanji, the storyit holds is a charming one. The silkworm (insect) eats the leavesof the mulberry bush (the flowers), digests them and transformsthem into thread with which it spins about itself, in mysticwisdom, its own coffin (the hood). The dividing line thatseparates the two elements helps the picture of the little wormcutting itself off from contact with the outside world, but as acharacter stroke, it is a clear exception.
